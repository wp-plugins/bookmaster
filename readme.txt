== Description ==

Displays link category titles without the links. Perfect for creating a navigation with link category titles only or listing the link category name elsewhere in the post or page away from the links themselves. 

By calling on a particular link category ID it's possible to display only that category name. It is not necessary to place this code within a loop.
